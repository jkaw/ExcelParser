This is an excel parser for names.
It is used to get all names from an excel file into an ArrayList for manipulation.
The names are gathered from excel using select all and pasting into a txt file. 
This includes a specific one, and a generic parser. The generic parser is not done yet. I's almost done, but I'm done working on this for now.
